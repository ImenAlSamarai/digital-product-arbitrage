## Research Applications

This system demonstrates practical implementation of:
- Large language model integration in business intelligence workflows
- Automated content generation with quality control mechanisms
- Multi-agent coordination for complex content production tasks
- Systematic approach to market opportunity assessment

## Usage
```bash
pip install anthropic fpdf2 matplotlib pillow numpy
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key"
python digital_agent.py    # Market analysis
python content_agent.py    # Content generation
python image_agent.py      # Visual asset creation
```

## Limitations and Considerations
The system operates within the constraints of current language model capabilities and requires manual validation for production deployment. Content quality varies based on prompt engineering effectiveness and market data availability.
